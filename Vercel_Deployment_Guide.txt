# Simple Vercel Deployment Guide via GitHub

## Overview
Deploy your HTML portfolio to Vercel by uploading to GitHub first, then connecting it to Vercel for automatic deployment.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `bishal-portfolio` (or any name you prefer)
4. Make it **Public** (so Vercel can access it)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Upload Your Files to GitHub
1. Download and install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Click "File" → "Clone repository"
4. Find your new repository and clone it to your computer
5. Copy all your portfolio files (HTML, CSS, images) into the cloned folder
6. In GitHub Desktop:
   - You'll see all files listed
   - Add a commit message: "Initial portfolio upload"
   - Click "Commit to main"
   - Click "Push origin"

## Step 3: Connect to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Click "Continue with GitHub"
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account
5. Find your repository (`bishal-portfolio`) and click "Import"
6. Vercel will auto-detect it's a static HTML site
7. Click "Deploy"

## Step 4: Your Site is Live!
- Vercel will provide a URL like: `https://bishal-portfolio.vercel.app`
- Your portfolio is now live worldwide!
- Any future changes you push to GitHub will auto-deploy

## Making Updates
1. Edit your files locally
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Commit and push changes
4. Vercel automatically redeploys your site

## Important Notes
- Keep all images in the `images/` folder
- Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
- Vercel provides free hosting, SSL, and global CDN
- You can add a custom domain later if needed

## That's it! Your portfolio is now live on the internet! 🎉
